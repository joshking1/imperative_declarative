# Imperative script for kubernetes 

# Try running the script against your GKE cluster, and check that the deployment
# was created successfully:

$ imperative-deployment.sh

deployment.apps/nginx-imperative created
deployment.apps/nginx-imperative scaled
deployment.apps/nginx-imperative annotated
deployment.apps/nginx-imperative annotated
$ kubectl get deployments

# NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE

nginx-imperative 3/3 3 3 27s

Great! The deployment was created as expected. But now letâ€™s edit our deployment.sh script to change the value of the organization annotation from sales to marketing and then rerun the script:

$ imperative-deployment-new.sh

Error from server (AlreadyExists): deployments.apps "nginx-imperative"
already exists
deployment.apps/nginx-imperative scaled
error: --overwrite is false but found the following declared annotation(s):
'environment' already has a value (prod)
error: --overwrite is false but found the following declared annotation(s):
'organization' already has a value (sales)
